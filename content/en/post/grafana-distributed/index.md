Welcome ðŸ‘‹. I'd like to present an architecture for monitoring distributed EKS clusters. This approach also applys to another Kubernetes cluster types. No vendor lock-in.

## Overview

1. EKS is convinience for provision and run workloads at ease.
2. Monitoring EKS solution providing by AWS is costly and tightly bound to Cloud Watch
3. Providing an opensource monitoring, easy allow to share with dev teams, sales and marketing teams.
